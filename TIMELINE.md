# Project's Timeline

This week-by-week timeline provides a rough guideline of how the project will be done.

## Pre-Project Work Period

Explore more about Homebrew and start contributing more on simple Issues.

Learn more about Ruby and GitHub Action, especially for the composite action method that will be used on the projects.

## Community Bonding Period (May 21 – June 13)

Update an Issues about Deduplicating GitHub Action, explaining about the current findings and open a discussion with other maintainers.

Reach out to the mentors and Ask some questions about the Homebrew community.

Keep in touch with mentors and actively discuss the project but not limited to specific issues.

Finalise the starting point of the project and ask the mentor thoughts about the starting point of the projects and set the goals.
