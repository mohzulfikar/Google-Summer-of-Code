My dream become true! This summer I got a chance to be GSoC contributor for Homebrew Project. I can't believe that I'm going to contribute to one of the open source tool I use every day.

I create this repository for my self-notes, a brief summary report to Homebrew community, as well as to help other students/contributors in the future that wants to know about what do I do in Google Summer of Code.

## ‚≠ê Project Abstract

[Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew) makes extensive use of GitHub Actions. Some of Homebrew workflows are very similar to each other and could be reused within the Homebrew organisation and community. This project will involve learning about Actions workflows in order to find ways to more efficiently use them across Homebrew projects.

## üö¢ Deliverables

This project aims to:

- Grouping an action step by using composite action and reuse it across Homebrew projects.
- Make a concise github action for better readability and troubleshooting for new contributors.
- Make more clear github action for new contributors, by using more descriptive names for action steps instead of multiple runs on each action step.

<!-- **All of the above deliverables were completed within the GSoC period. Yay! üéâ** -->
